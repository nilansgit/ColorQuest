# Task ID:- ColorQuest

Building a HSV-based color picker application similar to Google Color Picker, using Svelte. The picker should allow all three degrees of freedom (as in the Google Picker - hue with bottom slider, saturation on horizontal axis, value on vertical axis); any layout can be used to achieve this. It should also support 5 color formats (HEX, RGB, CMYK, HSL, HSV), allowing the user to input a value in any of these formats to change the selected color. Clicking and dragging the mouse on the slider or picker should also change all 5 values in real time.
